# Online-Store
## Capstone Project 2
This capstone project 2 was created in order to apply coding languages learnt from a full stack webdev bootcamp course at Hyperiondev. It was required to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create and design an online store. This online store is an online clothing store that allows users to add the clothing items to their cart and view their total due. This online clothing website includes a Home page, About Us page, Catalogue page with individual pages for each catalogue item, Delivery and Collection page, Exchanges and Returns page, Contact Us page, Cart page and a Search bar.
